# Mazana's Art Grid

My friend Mazana Bruggeman is a talented artist and graphic designer.

**You know how you stop seeing artwork in your home because it's been there for so long you just get
used to it?** Mazana has concepted a series of paintings for a dynamic installation. It's a system
of small pieces that are mounted on a grid backing and can be swapped out and rotated at will.

This website is intended to show the functionality of the system and eventually allow customers to
create and purchase their own customized installations.

At this time, I am working on the functionality of the site while she creates the artwork. Current
site images are open source placeholders.

See the deployed site at: https://ingridhoffman.github.io/mazana-art-grid/
